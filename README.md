In Eonian, players enter a magical inner world as alchemists dedicated to restoring an ancient city. This hidden realm is inhabited by mystical creatures known as Eonians, which have diminished in strength as the city has crumbled. To rebuild the city, players must explore Eonian's landscapes, gather rare ingredients, conduct alchemical rituals, and awaken the Eonians’ powers. Once revitalized, these creatures assist players in resurrecting the city’s lost wonders and bringing it back to life.
